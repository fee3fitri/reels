## Background
Reels is a full-stack, multi-page application clone of an award winning ecommerce site, called Rollies, where users can do online shopping and leave a review of products they bought. This project utilized Rails and postgreSQL for the backend, React/Redux and CSS3 for the frontend.
Reels is heavily focused on front-end animation and UI/UX design to mimic the original site which won a Site of The Day awards by awwwards.com.  

## Features
### User Authentication - Login/Signup
Reels user auth features allow user create an account or login, either with their own account or as a demo user. A login modal will popup when they are attempting to purchase an item, check their cart, or create a review without logged in. This authentication modal gives an easy access to try the site features without the need to leave their current page.

### Product Pages
Each product page shows product details where users can purchase the product. Users will be able to select the size options before they add item to the cart, update the item quantity of their cart, and delete item.
